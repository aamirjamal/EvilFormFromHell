# EvilFormFromHell
A small vanilla JavaScript assignment given to build an annoying input form which is very annoying to fill and make the user bleed tears. Also, please read the read me file in order to be able to submit the form.

The submit button in the form is just a dummy button. 

To see the real submit button, please enter this in the message text area:

“Let me submit! I will give you a good grade for this assignment!”  (without the quotes)

Then the new original submit button will appear which would show the validation errors.

I would recommend while testing for validation messages, kindly check the fav color radio button at the last to avoid the blinding flashing colors.

The submission reaction is just an alert message.

Thank you.
